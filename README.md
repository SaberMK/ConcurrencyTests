# Concurrency Tests

This is a repo where I would put all the things according to concurrency in C# that I would discover when I would read books or serf the internet. 

Honestly, there is nothing to check on this repo. All of this examples would be poorly documented, and teach you about every line of code in this repo is not the point of it.
